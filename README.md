### Nunjucks (v4, currently in alpha)

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is a full featured
templating engine for javascript. It is heavily inspired by
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). View the docs
[here](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

The main repository for nunjucks can be found at
[https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks).
This is an experimental rewrite that is not yet production ready.

The code in this repository adheres very closely to the functionality of
[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/); much more so than
earlier versions of nunjucks.

See [the release tracking ticket](https://github.com/nunjucks/nunjucks4/issues/1)
for a list of features that are known to be incomplete. If you should come
across a feature not listed, or a bug regression, please open a new issue.
